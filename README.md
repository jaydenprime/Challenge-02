## Challenge #2 Homework
In this challenge, I created a website from scratch with the content of being my portfolio. I will be updating this website as I learn and get more comfortable with coding.

## Description
I made box styles with css, with a title attached. The box titles are offset on desktop applications, and are centered in mobile applications. This is an example of me understanding viewports, and approaching content creation with a "mobile-first" approach. All links are working, anchoring to the correct section. Images are zoomed when hovered over in the "My Projects" section.

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
